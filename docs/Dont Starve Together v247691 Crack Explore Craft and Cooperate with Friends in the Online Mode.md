## From Beyond: Taking Root
` `
The v247691 update is part of the From Beyond series of updates, which introduce new biomes, creatures, items, and mechanics to the game. The first update in this series was From Beyond: The Ancient Archive, which added a mysterious underground labyrinth full of ancient relics and secrets. The second update is From Beyond: Taking Root, which adds a new surface biome called the Forest Deep.
` `
The Forest Deep is a lush and verdant area that is home to a variety of plants and animals. Some of them are friendly, such as the Leafy Bulbs that can be harvested for food or planted as crops, or the Bramble Husks that can be used as armor or fuel. Others are hostile, such as the Spitters that spit venomous projectiles at you, or the Snapdragons that can bite you with their sharp teeth.
` `
The Forest Deep also has some unique features that make it different from other biomes. For example, there are giant roots that can block your path or provide cover from enemies. There are also glowing mushrooms that can light up the area at night or be used as ingredients for crafting. And there are mysterious stone circles that can activate special events or grant you bonuses if you perform certain rituals.

## New Characters: Wurt and Wormwood
` `
The v247691 update also adds two new playable characters to the game: Wurt and Wormwood. Wurt is a fish-like creature that loves plants and hates pigs. She can craft unique items from plants, such as a Merm King figure or a Merm Flort-ifications. She can also befriend other Merms and lead them to war against the Pig King and his followers.
` `
Wormwood is a living plant that has a special connection to nature. He can plant seeds directly on the ground without using farms, and he can use living logs as a renewable resource. He can also heal himself by using manure or compost, but he takes damage from fire and loses sanity from cutting trees.
` `
Both Wurt and Wormwood have their own skins, quotes, animations, and sounds. They also have their own deluxe chests that contain exclusive items such as skins, portraits, emotes, and more. You can buy these chests from the Steam store or unlock them by playing the game.
